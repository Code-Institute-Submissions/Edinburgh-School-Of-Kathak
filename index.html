        <h2>What is Kathak Dance?</h2>
            <p>Kathak dance is one of the 8 Classical Dances of India. 
            Originating in the Hindu Temples, Kathak comes from the Sanskrit word Katha, meaning story. 
            Kathak dancers (Kathakars) told the epic stories of the Mahabharata and Ramayana, using a mixture of dance, facial expressions and mime. 
            Over time Kathak became established among the Indian Courts of Persian Kings, most notably, Wajid Ali Shah who was also himself a dancer and poet. 
            During this time the style developed technically, combining graceful hand movements, spins and fast complex footwork patterns. 
            Kathak, as we know it today, is a mixture of both the story telling aspects along with the technical performances.
