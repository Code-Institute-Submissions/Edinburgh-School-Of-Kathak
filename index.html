<h2>About The School</h2> 
<p>
Here at Edinburgh School of Kathak Dance, our focus is creating a safe space for individuals to learn Kathak, whilst meeting new people and having fun! Our aim is to provide structured lessons that cover all aspects of the Indian Classical art form, suitable to the level of the class, whilst our students learn the basic foundations that will stabilise their training as they become more advanced. 
We offer lessons both online and in a beautiful, clean dance studio, as well as private lessons for this who prefer one to one learning or cannot attend the classes available in the <a href="Timetable.html">timetable</a>.  
Along side your training, for those who are interested, we hold shows and regularly post on our social media pages to give our students the opportunity to share what they have learnt with us. We hope you join us on your Kathak Journey! Namaste x
